## Content

Material on this website is intended to be used during the December 2024 workshop as "case studies". Three researchers provided me with some of their field data and supporting information.

I've examined those data sets and with some back-and-forth with the researchers, have performed some distance sampling analyses.  The analyses are not intended to be definitive; nor are they intended to be elegant. 

I have included essentially everything I did and presented the analysis in the order in which I conducted it. This includes blind alleys I travelled. Hopefully I have provided narrative to compliment the analyses so readers can understand the rationale for the steps and the interpretation of the findings.
