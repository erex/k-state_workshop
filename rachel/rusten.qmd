## Before beginning, a note about point transects
- Animal movement can bias distance sampling estimates 
- Bias is magnified when animals move faster than observers
- Observers are stationary during point counts
- See @buckland2006 regarding "snapshot moment" to alleviate bias

## Becoming acquainted with data

```{r}
alldata <- read.csv(file="data/Rusten_GrasslandBird_dist24.csv")
(numstrat <- unique(alldata$Region.Label))
(numspec <- unique(alldata$Species))
```

Goodness, there are `r length(numspec)` species recorded during the 2024 field season. Let's focus attention upon four species of interest: GRSP, WEME, DICK, UPSA:

```{r}
fourspec <- subset(alldata, subset = Species %in% c("GRSP", "WEME", "DICK", "UPSA"))
table(fourspec$Region.Label, fourspec$Species)
```

Detections by `Region.Label` may be a bit sparse, particularly for UPSA. Let's see how number of detections changes if we aggregate at the level of `Group`.

```{r}
table(fourspec$Group, fourspec$Species)
```

That is an improvement.

### Transects within Region.Label or Group

I'm unsure about the naming scheme for points stations. It seems most sensible for transects to "belong" to strata, but the numbering system does not seem to follow that. Perhaps using `GridPointID` as `Sample.Label` makes more sense? In most instances, it seems there are 12 replicate `GridPointID` values.

```{r}
unique(fourspec$GridPointID[fourspec$Region.Label=="Double W"])
```

I'll modify the working data frame to make `GridPointID` the point transect identified `Sample.Label`.

```{r}
fourspec$Sample.Label <- fourspec$GridPointID
```


### Birds in flocks

Is this of significance?

```{r}
table(fourspec$Species, fourspec$Flock)
```

Only `r round(100-(746/(746+13+4)) * 100,1)`\% of dickcissel detections were of flocks >1 individual, which is unlikely to alter the abundance/density estimates noticeably. 

We will see if that makes a difference.

## Exploratory data analysis of detection distances

:::{.callout-caution collapse=false appearance='default' icon=true}
## Distances recorded as -1
Don't know why they exist, but they mess with detection function fitting, I'm throwing them out
:::

```{r}
fourspec <- subset(fourspec, subset = distance> -1)
```


```{r}
#| layout-ncol: 2
hist(fourspec$distance[fourspec$Species=="GRSP"], 
     main="GRSP", xlab="Radial distance", nc=40)
hist(fourspec$distance[fourspec$Species=="WEME"], 
     main="WEME", xlab="Radial distance", nc=40)
hist(fourspec$distance[fourspec$Species=="DICK"], 
     main="DICK", xlab="Radial distance", nc=40)
```

Probably rounding of distances for meadowlark around 200 and 300m, but that shouldn't cause problems.

## Simple analysis for estimates at the `Group` level

Standard practice will be to remove 10% most distant detections.

```{r}
#| label: weme
library(Distance)
cu <- convert_units("meter", NULL, "hectare")
weme <- subset(fourspec, Species=="WEME")
weme.hn <- ds(data=weme, transect = "point",
         key="hn", truncation = "10%",  convert_units = cu, adjustment = "herm")
weme.uncos <- ds(data=weme, transect = "point",
         key="unif", truncation = "10%",  convert_units = cu)
weme.hr <- ds(data=weme, transect = "point",
         key="hr", truncation = "10%",  convert_units = cu, adjustment = "poly")
summarize_ds_models(weme.hn, weme.uncos, weme.hr)
plot(weme.hr, pdf=TRUE, nc=40, main="WEME, HR, pooled detfn")
```


```{r}
#| label: dick
cu <- convert_units("meter", NULL, "hectare")
dick <- fourspec[fourspec$Species=="DICK",]
dick.hn <- ds(data=dick, transect = "point",
         key="hn", truncation = "10%",  convert_units = cu, adjustment = "herm")
dick.uncos <- ds(data=dick, transect = "point",
         key="unif", truncation = "10%",  convert_units = cu)
dick.hr <- ds(data=dick, transect = "point",
         key="hr", truncation = "10%",  convert_units = cu, adjustment = "poly")
summarize_ds_models(dick.hn, dick.uncos, dick.hr)
plot(dick.hr, pdf=TRUE, nc=40, main="DICK, HR, pooled detfn")
```

```{r}
#| label: grsp
cu <- convert_units("meter", NULL, "hectare")
grsp <- fourspec[fourspec$Species=="GRSP",]
grsp.hn <- ds(data=grsp, transect = "point",
         key="hn", truncation = "10%",  convert_units = cu, adjustment = "herm")
grsp.uncos <- ds(data=grsp, transect = "point",
         key="unif", truncation = "10%",  convert_units = cu)
grsp.hr <- ds(data=grsp, transect = "point",
         key="hr", truncation = "10%",  convert_units = cu, adjustment = "poly")
summarize_ds_models(grsp.hn, grsp.uncos, grsp.hr)
plot(grsp.uncos, pdf=TRUE, nc=25, main="GRSP, unicos, pooled detfn")
```

## Constant detectability across strata?

Clearly there are insufficient detections within strata to fit stratum-specific detection functions. However, as shown in @rexstad2023, bias will result from using a pooled detection function to estimate density at the stratum level **if** detectability differs between strata.  

The defensible way to estimate stratum-specific detection probabilities with small stratum-specific detections is to use stratum as a covariate. This may not work for the large number of strata we have here. The hazard rate model was preferred for two of the three species and it was second-preferred for the GRSP, so attempt covariate modelling using hazard rate as key function.

```{r}
#| eval: false
weme.hrstrat <- ds(data=weme, transect="point", key="hr", truncation="10%",
                   convert_units = cu, formula=~Region.Label)
dick.hrstrat <- ds(data=dick, transect="point", key="hr", truncation="10%",
                   convert_units = cu, formula=~Region.Label)
grsp.hrstrat <- ds(data=grsp, transect="point", key="hr", truncation="10%",
                   convert_units = cu, formula=~Region.Label)
```

## Convergence warning)
There are convergence problems with the meadowlark data when using stratum as a covariate
:::

Contrast models with and without Region.Label covariate for each species to provide an evidence-based assessment of constant detectability across strata.

```{r}
#| eval: false
AIC(weme.hr, weme.hrstrat)
AIC(dick.hr, dick.hrstrat)
AIC(grsp.uncos, grsp.hrstrat)
```

If you are fussy, you could use `BIC` rather than `AIC`.

As an experiment, use `Group` as strata and fit group as a covariate. Won't work because `Area` specified for the grid, not group.

```{r}
#| eval: false
experiment <- fourspec
experiment$Region.Label <- experiment$Group
weme.group <- subset(experiment, Species=="WEME")
weme.hrgroup <- ds(data=weme.group, transect="point", key="hr", truncation="10%",
                   convert_units = cu, formula=~Region.Label)
```

Different idea, remove `Region.Label` for which there are fewer than 13 detections

```{r}
weme.small <- subset(weme, subset = !(Region.Label %in% 
                       c("GAR-LOWja", "GAR046-B", "WHE035-A", "GAR041-B")))
weme.hrsmall <- ds(data=weme.small, transect="point", key="hr", truncation="10%",
                   convert_units = cu, formula=~Region.Label)
summary(weme.hrsmall)
```

The convergence may still not be perfect; however the CVs at the stratum level are reasonable, staying below 0.35.

```{r}
#| out-height: "800px"
#| out-width: "700px"
plot(weme.hrsmall, pdf=TRUE)
rlabels <- unique(weme.small$Region.Label)
for (i in 1:length(rlabels)) {
  add_df_covar_line(weme.hrsmall, data=data.frame(Region.Label=rlabels[i]),
                    lwd=2, lty=1, pdf=TRUE, col=colours(TRUE)[i])
}
legend("topright", title="Strata", legend=rlabels,
       lwd=2, lty=1, col=colours(TRUE), cex=0.8)
```

The plot of the probability density functions at the stratum level indicates one stratum with a *very* different detection function shape compared to the rest of the strata (WHE014). This may explain the convergence challenge. That stratum might be a candidate for exclusion.

```{r}
hist(weme$distance[weme$Region.Label=="WHE014"], xlim=c(0,190), nc=10,
     xlab="Radial distance", main="Stratum WHE014 detections of WEME")
```

Note the SE of the stratum-$\hat{\beta}$ associated with stratum `WHE014` `r summary(weme.hrsmall$ddf)$coeff$key.scale[27,2]`
